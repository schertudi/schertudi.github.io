                        This was for a university project where we had to develop our own VR game of choice. This time it was a solo project.
						<br/><br/>
						Virtual reality games come with their own set of advantages and limitations. Of course, they can be much more immersive than traditional desktop games. Because of this, I thought a horror game might be well-suited to VR.
						<br/><br/>
						However transportation is often a sticky spot in VR games due to the risk of motion sickness. How to properly solve this remains an open question. I think the success of Beat Saber comes from the fact that the player doesn't need to move at all - instead, the game world comes to them. I wanted to experiment with this concept, so I restricted player movement in this game. The player can turn around, but they can't leave their spot.
						<br/><br/>
						The end result of this thought process was a horror experience that restricts player movement, with the intention that this would make it scarier. Thus, this game was born. 
						<br/><br/>

					<h3>Gameplay</h3>
						The basic mechanic is that you must "knead" bread by hitting it with either VR controller. As you prepare the bread, the scene grows more demonic, and the bread you are kneading comes to life. You are now surrounded by bread zombies. These crowd in on you from all sides while you try to fight them off with the rolling pin, having nowhere to run.
