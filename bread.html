                        This was for a university project where we had to develop our own VR game of choice. This time it was a solo project.
						<br/><br/>
						Virtual reality games come with their own set of advantages and limitations. Of course, they can be much more immersive than traditional desktop games. Because of this, I thought a horror game might be well-suited to VR.
						<br/><br/>
						However transportation is often a sticky spot in VR games due to the risk of motion sickness. How to properly solve this remains an open question. I think the success of Beat Saber comes from the fact that the player doesn't need to move at all - instead, the game world comes to them. I wanted to experiemnt with this concept, so I restricted player movement in this game. The player can turn around, but they can't leave their spot.
						<br/><br/>
						The end result of this thought process was a horror experience that restricts player movement, with the intention that this would make it scarier. Thus, this game was born.
